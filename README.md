Making a connection between Fourses Expander and an IFM Fourses is very simple and straight forward, it only requires a total of 9 short wires, the 9th wire being Ground. 


Feel free to download the Gerber files for the PCB and for the Panel. 
If using JLCPCB - Make sure to select "Confirm Production Files" - this way you can make sure that they plan to add the silkscreen to the panel... sometimes, for some reason, with bare FR4, no soldermask, they will skip your silkscreen.
Selecting Confirm Production Files avoids any kind of issues or headaches.
